Pandas Library
The Pandas library is the standard API for dealing with data. 
Data is all information we have around, information that we consider of interest. 
Data can be numeric or textual. For our tasks of classifying text, 
Pandas gives us tools to handle small to large text bodies, the main one being a dataframe.

Dataframes are object-based structures for data storage and manipulation. 
Through its methods, we can do many operations to the data. 
Common ones are to filter the data into smaller sets, to add new data or dataframes to it, 
and perform data exchanges with other dataframes.
