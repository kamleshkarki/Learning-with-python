with Python!
Some of Python's notable features:
Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.
Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.
This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.
Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers,
searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.
Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code.
Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix, with unofficial builds also available for Android and iOS.
